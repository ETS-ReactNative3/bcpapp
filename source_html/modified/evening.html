<BcpText>Jesus said, "You are the light of the world. A city built on a {'\n'}
hill cannot be hid. No one lights a lamp to put it under a {'\n'}
bucket, but on a lamp-stand where it gives light for everyone {'\n'}
in the house. And you, like the lamp, must shed light among {'\n'}
your fellow men, so that they may see the deed you do, and {'\n'}
give glory to your Father in heaven." {'   '}<em class="small">Matthew 5:14-16</em></BcpText>

{'\n'}
{'\n'}

<BcpText>It is not ourselves that we proclaim; we proclaim Christ {'\n'}
Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants, for Jesus' sake. {'\n'}
For the same God who said, "Out of darkness let light shine," {'\n'}
has caused his light to shine within us, to give the light of r{'\n'}
evelation&#151;the revelation of the glory of God in the face of {'\n'}
Jesus Christ. {'   '}<em class="small">2 Corinthians 4:5-6</em>{'\n'}
{'\n'}
<BcpText>If I say, "Surely the darkness will cover me, and the light {'\n'}
around me turn to night," darkness is not dark to you, O {'\n'}
Lord; the night is as bright as the day; darkness and light to {'\n'}
you are both alike. {'   '}<em class="small">Psalm 139:10-11</em></BcpText>

Almighty God, we give you thanks for surrounding us, as {'\n'}
daylight fades, with the brightness of the vesper light; and we {'\n'}
implore you of your great mercy that, as you enfold us with {'\n'}
the radiance of this light, so you would shine into our hearts {'\n'}
the brightness of your Holy Spirit; through Jesus Christ our {'\n'}
Lord. <Italic>Amen.</Italic>{'\n'}
{'\n'}
Grant us, Lord, the lamp of charity which never fails, that it {'\n'}
may burn in us and shed its light on those around us, and {'\n'}
that by its brightness we may have a vision of that holy City, {'\n'}
where dwells the true and never-failing Light, Jesus Christ {'\n'}
our Lord. <Italic>Amen.</Italic>{'\n'}
{'\n'}
O Lord God Almighty, as you have taught us to call the {'\n'}
evening, the morning, and the noonday one day; and have {'\n'}
made the sun to know its going down: Dispel the darkness of {'\n'}
our hearts, that by your brightness we may know you to be {'\n'}
the true God and eternal light, living and reigning for ever {'\n'}
and ever. <Italic>Amen.</Italic></BcpText>
