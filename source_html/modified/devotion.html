some other convenient manner. (For suggestions about reading the{'\n'}
Psalms, see <a href="../Psalter/concerning_the_psalter.html">page 582</a>.){'\n'}
{'\n'}
For convenience, appropriate Psalms, Readings, and Collects are{'\n'}
provided in each service. When desired, however, the Collect of the{'\n'}
Day, or any of the Collects appointed in the Daily Offices, may be used{'\n'}
instead.{'\n'}
{'\n'}
The Psalms and Readings may be replaced by those appointed in{'\n'}
{'\n'}
a) the Lectionary for Sundays, Holy Days, the Common of Saints, and{'\n'}
Various Occasions, <a href="../RCL/concernlect.html">page 888</a>{'\n'}
{'\n'}
b) the Daily Office Lectionary, <a href="../DOLectionary/concerndolect.html">page 934</a>{'\n'}
