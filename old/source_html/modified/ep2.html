<h2>Daily Evening Prayer:{'\n'}
Rite Two</h2>{'\n'}
{'\n'}
{'\n'}

<p class="rubric" id="sentences">The Officiant begins the service with one or more of the following{'\n'}
sentences of Scripture, or of those on pages 75-78;</BcpText>

<SmallItalic>or with the Service of Light on pages 109-112, and continuing with the{'\n'}
appointed Psalmody;</SmallItalic>

<SmallItalic>or with the versicle "O God, make speed to save us" on page 117</SmallItalic>

Let my prayer be set forth in your sight as incense, the lifting{'\n'}
up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. {'   '}<SmallItalic>Psalm 141:2</SmallItalic>{'\n'}
{'\n'}

Grace to you and peace from God our Father and from the{'\n'}
Lord Jesus Christ. {'   '}<SmallItalic>Philippians 1:2</SmallItalic>{'\n'}
{'\n'}

Worship the Lord in the beauty of his holiness; let the whole earth{'\n'}
tremble before him. {'   '}<SmallItalic>Psalm 96:9</SmallItalic>{'\n'}
{'\n'}

Yours is the day, O God, yours also the night; you established{'\n'}
the moon and the sun. You fixed all the boundaries of the{'\n'}
earth; you made both summer and winter. {'   '}<SmallItalic>Psalm 74:15,16</SmallItalic>{'\n'}
{'\n'}

I will bless the Lord who gives me counsel; my heart teaches{'\n'}
me, night after night. I have set the Lord always before me;{'\n'}
because he is at my right hand, I shall not fall. {'   '}<SmallItalic>Psalm 16:7,8</SmallItalic>{'\n'}
{'\n'}

Seek him who made the Pleiades and Orion, and turns deep{'\n'}
darkness into the morning, and darkens the day into night;{'\n'}
who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out upon{'\n'}
the surface of the earth: The Lord is his name. {'   '}<SmallItalic>Amos 5:8</SmallItalic></BcpText>

<BcpText>{'\n'}
{'\n'}
If I say, "Surely the darkness will cover me, and the light{'\n'}
around me turn to night," darkness is not dark to you, O{'\n'}
Lord; the night is as bright as the day; darkness and light to{'\n'}
you are both alike. {'   '}<SmallItalic>Psalm 139:10,11</SmallItalic>{'\n'}
{'\n'}

Jesus said, "I am the light of the world; whoever follows me{'\n'}
will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."{'\n'}
